# Game of Life in Python with Tkinter

This repository contains the code for an implementation of John Conway's Game of Life using Python and Tkinter for the graphical user interface. The Game of Life is a cellular automaton that follows three simple rules to determine the state of a cell (alive or dead) based on its neighbors.

## Features

1. **Python Implementation:** The code is written in Python, a versatile and easy-to-learn programming language. The game logic is based on efficient manipulation of arrays and matrices using the numpy library.
2. **Graphical User Interface:** This implementation includes a GUI created using Tkinter, which allows for real-time interaction with the game grid. Users can manually switch cells on or off, control the game speed, and start, stop, or step through the game.
3. **Modular Design:** The code is separated into two modules: `gui.py` handles the user interface, and `game_of_life.py` contains the core game logic. This separation of concerns makes the code easier to read, understand, and modify.
